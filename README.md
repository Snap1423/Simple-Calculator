# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

This is my **first Python project** — a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations using `match-case`.

## ✨ Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid inputs with error messages

## 🛠 How it Works
1. The program asks the user to enter two numbers.  
2. Then it asks which operation to perform (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
3. It shows the result of the operation.  
4. If the user enters invalid input (like letters instead of numbers), it shows a friendly error message instead of crashing.

## 📂 Project Structure

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install Python (3.10 or above for `match-case`).  
2. Run the program in your terminal/command prompt:  

```bash
python calculator.py

📸 Example Run
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 2
What kind of operation do you want to perform? 
Press '+' for addition
Press '-' for subtraction
Press '*' for multiplication
Press '/' for division.
Enter the operation: *
The result is : 16
